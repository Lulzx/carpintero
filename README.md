# Carpintero

*Documentation: <https://lulzx.com/carpintero/>*

A PARSE-class grammar dialect for [Arturo](https://arturo-lang.io): rules are
ordinary Arturo blocks that compose, nest, and recurse, and they match
strings *and* blocks, so Arturo can pattern-match its own source.

```red
digit: charset "0-9"

date: [
    capture 'year  [4 digit]  "-"
    capture 'month [2 digit]  "-"
    capture 'day   [2 digit]
]

scan "2026-08-03" date
; => [year: "2026" month: "08" day: "03"]
```

`scan` returns a dictionary of captures, or `null` on failure. `scan?`
returns a boolean. `scan.prefix` accepts a prefix match and reports how far
it reached. After a failed scan, `scanError` tells you where and why:

```
scan "2026-08-0x" date
print scanError
; scan failed at line 1, column 10 — expected: digit  (while matching: day)
;     2026-08-0x
;              ^
```

A terminal that has a rule name is reported by that name, the innermost
enclosing rule or capture becomes the while-matching context, and the
offending line is shown with a caret under the column. For block input
the report gives an index, or a path of indices into the nested
structure when the failure is inside `into`.

Block input uses the language's own type values as terminals:

```red
funcdef: [
    capture 'name :label
    'function
    capture 'params :block
    capture 'body   :block
]

scan code [any [funcdef | skip]]
```

## Using it

One file, no dependencies, nothing to build. Copy `carpintero.art` next to
your script and import it:

```red
import ./"carpintero.art"!

digit: charset "0-9"
scan "2026-08-03" [capture 'year [4 digit] "-" capture 'month [2 digit] "-" capture 'day [2 digit]]
```

Arturo 0.10.0 or later. `info.art` is the `pkgr.art` manifest for whenever
the semantics are settled enough to publish; until then it is a clone away.

## Vocabulary

| Group | Words |
| --- | --- |
| Quantify | `some` (1+), `any` (0+), `opt`, `N rule`, `between N M rule` |
| Choose | `\|` ordered alternation, blocks for grouping |
| Advance | `to` (exclusive), `thru` (inclusive), `skip`, `end` |
| Look | `ahead`, `not` |
| Capture | `capture 'name rule`, `collect 'name rule` + `keep rule` |
| Descend | `into rule` (match a nested block in full with its own rules) |
| Escape | `do [...]` host code, `defer [...]` commit-time host code, `quote value` literal match, `fail "msg"` |
| Commit | `cut` (commit the innermost enclosing choice) |
| Match | strings, chars, charsets, `:type` values, `'word` literals, named rules |

Charsets are values and compose: `csUnion`, `csIntersect`,
`csComplement` (the unprefixed words belong to core, for blocks).

Two utilities ride along. `stripComments` removes comments from a source
string with a Carpintero grammar, and `loadSafe` reads a file, strips it,
and returns the lexed block, sidestepping the 0.10.0 lexer bug where a
backslash in a `;;` documentation comment hangs the interpreter
(`examples/safeload.art` runs a file that hangs `arturo` directly).

## Two implementations

`carpintero.art` is the reference: the whole dialect in pure Arturo,
covering the proposal's Phase 0 to 2 and the interpreted half of Phase 3
(`cut`, `defer`, opt-in memoization, benchmarks). It is the specification,
and where the two disagree it is the one that is right.

[`nim/`](nim/README.md) is the compiled core the proposal asks upstream
for: an LPeg-style instruction set matching text and blocks, built
standalone so it needs no Arturo build to develop. The two share no
matching code, so they are held together by running the same grammar over
the same input and comparing:

```
scripts/differential-corpus.sh ../arturo
```

Over Arturo's own source both engines find the same 287 definitions in the
same 168 files, with the same captures and no disagreement.

Reaching that speed from Arturo needs a builtin, which would mean changing
Arturo, so this package does not. `nim/adapter/fast.art` goes through the
FFI instead, which is worth having and still not the engine:

| | Corpus scan | |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `scan` | 15.8 s | pure Arturo, the reference |
| `scanFast` | 0.25 s | the shared library, no change to Arturo |
| the core on values it already holds | 0.03 s | what direct access would expose |

Most of the middle row is serialisation: 0.19 seconds to render the input
against 0.045 to cross the boundary and match, after five rounds of making
the two ends faster. The measurement, and what it argues, is in
[nim/README.md](nim/README.md).

## Semantics worth knowing

Four that surprise people. All deliberate, all argued in
[proposal.md](proposal.md), all covered in full by [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md).

- **The whole input must match.** A rule that matches a prefix and stops
  short is a failure. `scan.prefix` is the other mode.
- **Captures roll back.** A capture made in an alternative that later fails
  leaves nothing behind, and the same goes for `keep`. Rebol and Red do the
  opposite, on purpose here.
- **`do` escapes may run more than once**, on parse paths that are later
  abandoned, so they should compute rather than mutate. `defer` is the sound
  alternative: queued in the capture log, run once on overall success, and
  discarded with a dead branch.
- **Loops cannot spin.** In `some` and `any`, an *optional* pass that
  matches without consuming ends the loop, and is not taken: what it
  captured rolls back with it. Mandatory passes are always taken, which is
  the whole difference between the two, since `some rule` is one mandatory
  pass followed by `any rule`. The counted forms need no guard at all,
  because a bound already terminates them, so `4 rule` and `between 2 5
  rule` run their body whether or not it consumes, and `between 2 2 rule`
  means what `2 rule` means. Left recursion is rejected at scan start with
  the cycle named.

Matching is case-sensitive and works on characters, not bytes.

## Running everything

```
scripts/run-tests.sh
```

| Suite | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests.art` | 373 checks over the interpreted matcher |
| `tests-panics.art` | 18 grammar errors, one interpreter each |
| `nim/tests/test_vm.nim` | 46 checks over the compiled core |
| `nim/tests/test_wire.nim` | the FFI input read both ways and compared |
| `nim/tests/differential.nim` | 78 cases run in both engines and compared |
| `demo.art` | 71 checks, written to be read rather than to cover |

The panic cases need one interpreter apiece: a panic unwound through `try`
leaves the abandoned frames' values behind for the next statements to
misread, so a single process cannot check more than one of them.

Those suites ask the questions someone thought to ask. `scripts/fuzz.sh`
asks the rest:

```
scripts/fuzz.sh 10 100
```

Each batch writes random grammars with the interpreted answer attached and
reruns them in the compiled core, which is the differential runner reading
its ordinary case format. Grammars are well formed by construction, so a
batch that dies is a finding rather than noise, and every batch leaves a
listing beside its case file naming the grammar behind each disagreement.
Four semantic disagreements came out of it, each shrunk to a grammar a
line long and now pinned in the tables above: which passes of a loop are
guarded, whether a bounded repeat counts a pass that consumed nothing,
and what the empty string means against a block.

## Examples

[`examples/`](examples/README.md) holds the proposal's three demos, each
runnable on its own: JSON in thirteen rules (`json.art`), RFC 4180 CSV in
nine (`csv.art`), and Arturo scanning its own source, one rule extracting
every function definition from `carpintero.art` itself (`arturo-scan.art`).

`arturo-corpus.art` takes that last one all the way. Point it at a checkout
of Arturo and it runs both grammars over every `.art` file in the language's
own tree. On a megabyte of source, stripping comments never once changed the
program the lexer builds, and a five-line block grammar found all 287
function definitions at every nesting depth. [The write-up is in the
manual](MANUAL.md#validation-against-arturos-own-source), including the
interpreter bug it turned up.

`bench.art` is the Phase 3 benchmark: `scan` losing to the native regex
engine by the expected orders of magnitude, memoization collapsing a
deliberately exponential grammar from a sixth of a second to a millisecond
and a half, and a cost per kilobyte that stays flat as the input doubles.

## Interpreter bugs

[`bugs/`](bugs/README.md) has minimal repros for three Arturo 0.10.0
interpreter bugs: a backslash in a `;;` documentation comment that hangs
the lexer, a
value-stack underflow that exits 1 without a word, and a `:symbolliteral`
that is not equal to itself. The
first two were found by writing the dialect and the third by running it over
Arturo's own test suite. A fourth repro is filed alongside them and is not a
bug: a value left unused inside a callee is popped as an argument by the
enclosing call, which is the value stack working as designed, down to the
displaced argument waiting there for the next call that wants one. Each has
an in-language workaround, used in `carpintero.art`.
